Currently in my final year of a bachelorâ€™s degree in information systems, I have developed a passion for cybersecurity through participation in CTFs hosted by organizations such as the NSA, NCL, Snyk, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe. I enjoy writing code to break cryptographic ciphers and am eager to learn more about the field. I joined CLARK.center to connect with industry professionals, contribute to the cybersecurity community, and serve as a proxy for sharing valuable content.
